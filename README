tw_mon
======

A simple monitoring script for the LSI/3ware RAID cards that use the
tw_cli program to interface with the card.

Install
-------

This project does not include `tw_cli`, which can be downloaded here:
<http://www.lsi.com/DistributionSystem/User/AssetMgr.aspx?asset=53593>

Be sure to replace `_EMAIL_TO_` and `_EMAIL_FROM_` with the correct email
addresses, or this script won't work properly. Also, check and adjust
the other configuration values at the top of the script to reflect
the appropriate paths and settings for your server.

Usage
-----

When executed, this script runs persistently in the background, checking
the status of the RAID controller ever 5 minutes. If the status ever
changes (from good to bad, bad to good, or anything in between), this
script will send a notification email with the RAID status as reported
by `tw_cli`.

To run in the background, use the shell's background function, as below:

    ./tw_mon &

Alternatively, you can wrap tw_mon in a SysV-style rc script to allow it
to start and stop as a service.
